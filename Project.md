This code represents a TypeScript function called `generateGatingRulesForRequest` responsible for processing an array of `DealerAssociation` objects to generate gating rules based on certain conditions. Here's a breakdown:

- **Imports**: This section imports various modules, services, models, validators, and utility functions required for this file's operation.

- **Function Signature**: 
  - The function `generateGatingRulesForRequest` is asynchronous (`async`) and expects two parameters:
    - `request`: An array of `DealerAssociation` objects.
    - `overwritePrograms`: A boolean flag indicating whether to overwrite existing programs or not.

- **Function Logic**:
  - It initializes a `serviceResponse` array to store the results.
  - Validates the incoming `request` using the `validate` function from the gating-master-validator module.
  - Processes each item in the `request` array asynchronously using `Promise.all`:
    - If the request is invalid, it logs the details and pushes an error response object to `serviceResponse`.
    - Otherwise, it retrieves current gating rules for the dealer (`req.dealerCd`) and updates the gating rules based on the associated programs.
    - If there are warning messages, it creates a warning response object; otherwise, it pushes the updated gating rule object to `serviceResponse`.
  - Logs the `serviceResponse` after processing the requests.
  - Determines the HTTP status code based on the presence of error messages in the `serviceResponse`.
  - Constructs a response object with the determined status code, content type, and the `serviceResponse` as JSON in the body.

The final part of the code, currently commented out, seems to involve updating a DynamoDB table (`AppConfig.dspDealerMappingTable`) if certain conditions are met and returning a success or failure response accordingly.

This function mainly processes incoming `DealerAssociation` objects, generates gating rules based on their details, and constructs a response indicating the success or failure of the process.

1. **Imports:** The code imports necessary modules from various libraries (`aws-sdk`, `pg`, `lodash`) and internal configurations (`AppConfig`, `constants`) required for AWS services, database operations, and other utilities.

2. **Functions:**
    - `databaseUpdate`: This function takes an array of files and a pool configuration object as input and performs multiple operations:
        - Reads an indicator file from S3 to get MD5 details.
        - Checks the MD5 integrity against the files in the array.
        - Processes the files, creates SQL queries, and inserts records into the database based on certain conditions.
        - Deletes files from S3 based on specific conditions.
        - Returns a boolean indicating the success or failure of the database update.

    - Other functions within `databaseUpdate` are utility functions for specific database operations (`insertHDRTable`, `insertLineItemTable`, etc.), creating notifications for certain file types, and checking MD5 integrity (`checkmd5` and `readIndicatorFile`).

3. **Asynchronous Operations:**
    - The code extensively uses `async/await` with `Promise` objects to handle asynchronous tasks, especially while interacting with AWS S3, the PostgreSQL database, and performing other file-related operations.

4. **Error Handling:**
    - The code includes error handling using `try/catch` blocks and logs detailed error messages using the `log` utility from `@tmna-libraries/node-commons`.

5. **Database Operations:**
    - Several functions (`insertHDRTable`, `insertLineItemTable`, etc.) execute SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database using the `pg` library's `Pool` object.

6. **S3 Operations:**
    - Functions like `readIndicatorFile` and `deleteSource` interact with AWS S3 using the `AWS.S3` object to read indicator files and delete files from the S3 bucket.

7. **Business Logic:**
    - The code contains specific business logic to handle different file types, create notifications for different entities based on database records, and manage the execution flow based on certain conditions.

Overall, this module orchestrates file processing from an S3 bucket, MD5 validation, database updates, and associated notifications and error handling. It's quite comprehensive, covering various aspects of file management and database interactions within an AWS environment.

This code appears to be an AWS Lambda function written in TypeScript that serves to perform various operations based on an event trigger, likely associated with AWS S3 bucket actions. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

1. **Imports:** The code imports various AWS SDK modules (`aws-sdk`) and other custom-defined modules for configuration, logging, database operations, etc.

2. **Functions:**
   - `notifyLaborOperations`: This is the main Lambda handler function. It's triggered by an event (presumably an S3 event) and performs several tasks:
     - Initializes configuration and credentials.
     - Lists objects in an S3 bucket's 'outgoing/' folder.
     - Updates a database based on the listed contents.
     - Deletes a specific file from the S3 bucket.
     - Sends alert emails based on the success or failure of the operations.
     - Stops an EC2 instance.
     - Returns appropriate responses based on success or failure.

   - `deleteIndicator`: A function responsible for deleting a specific object from an S3 bucket.

3. **Variable Declarations:**
   - `poolConfig`: Configuration object for a PostgreSQL connection.
   - `deleteparams`: Parameters object for deleting an object from an S3 bucket.
   - `s3`: Instance of the AWS S3 service.

4. **Asynchronous Operations:**
   - The code uses asynchronous operations (`async/await`) extensively, especially when interacting with AWS services (S3, EC2), handling database operations, and sending emails.
   - It uses `Promise` objects to handle asynchronous behavior and employs `try/catch` blocks to catch and handle errors.

5. **Error Handling and Notifications:**
   - The code handles errors by logging them and sending alert emails, then stopping the EC2 instance. It returns appropriate HTTP status codes (`200` for success, `500` for errors) along with descriptive messages.

6. **External Dependencies:**
   - It relies on external configurations, credentials, and constants imported from other files (`AppConfig`, `constants`, etc.).

Overall, this Lambda function seems to manage a workflow that involves processing files in an S3 bucket, updating a PostgreSQL database, and performing other associated tasks with error handling and notifications for success or failure.

Certainly! This code snippet appears to be a function responsible for stopping an EC2 instance using the AWS SDK.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Imports:** The code imports necessary modules like `AWS` from the AWS SDK, `log` from the '@tmna-libraries/node-commons', `AppConfig` from a configuration file, and `constants` from a utility file.

2. **`stopEc2Instance` function:**
    - This function is designed to stop an EC2 instance.
    - It begins by creating an instance of the `AWS.EC2` service.
    - It prepares the parameters required for the `stopInstances` method, specifying the instance ID(s) to stop (retrieved from `AppConfig.bastionId`), and sets `DryRun` to `false`.
    - Updates the AWS configuration with the specified region from `AppConfig`.
    - Calls the `stopInstances` method asynchronously, which takes the prepared parameters and a callback function.
    - Inside the callback function, it checks for errors or successful data returned from the `stopInstances` operation.
    - If an error occurs during the `stopInstances` call, it logs an error message using the `log.error` method.
    - If the operation is successful, it logs a success message with details about the stopped instances.

3. **Error Handling:**
    - The code employs a try/catch block to catch any synchronous errors that might occur during the setup or EC2 stopping process.
    - If any error is caught, it's logged using `log.error` and rethrown as an error for potential higher-level error handling.

This function encapsulates the logic to stop an EC2 instance using the AWS SDK, handles errors that might occur during the process, and logs the status of the operation accordingly.

***"
This function, `deleteSource`, is responsible for deleting a file from an S3 bucket using the AWS SDK's `deleteObject` method. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Imports:** The code imports `log` from `@tmna-libraries/node-commons` for logging purposes and `constants` from a utility file containing constant values.

2. **`deleteSource` function:**
    - Takes three parameters: `s3` (the AWS S3 service object), `bucketName` (name of the S3 bucket), and `fileName` (name of the file to delete).
    - Returns a `Promise<any>` to handle the asynchronous deletion operation.

3. **Deleting the Object:**
    - Prepares the `deleteparams` object with the required parameters - the `Bucket` name and the `Key` (the path to the file in the S3 bucket).
    - Uses `s3.deleteObject` to delete the specified file asynchronously.
    - Provides a callback function that handles the result of the deletion operation.
    - If an error occurs during deletion, it logs an error message using `log.error`, mentioning the file name and the error details, then resolves the Promise with `false` to indicate a failure.
    - If the deletion is successful, it logs a success message using `log.info` and resolves the Promise with `true` to indicate success.

4. **Promise Handling:**
    - Wraps the deletion operation inside a `Promise` to manage the asynchronous nature of the `deleteObject` function.
    - `await` is used to ensure the completion of the deletion operation before resolving or rejecting the `Promise`.

This function encapsulates the logic to delete a specific file (`fileName`) from a specified S3 bucket (`bucketName`) using the AWS SDK's `deleteObject` method, providing error logging and Promise-based handling for deletion success or failure.


****

This function, `sendAlertMail`, is responsible for sending alert emails using AWS SES (Simple Email Service). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Imports:** The code imports necessary modules like `AWS` from the AWS SDK, `log`, and `tmnaInit` from `@tmna-libraries/node-commons`, `Callback`, `Context` from 'aws-lambda', `AppConfig` from a configuration file, and `constants` from a utility file.

2. **`sendAlertMail` function:**
    - Takes three parameters: `status` (boolean indicating success or failure), `errorObj` (details about the error), and `context` (AWS Lambda context).
    - Uses `tmnaInit` to initialize the configuration using `AppConfig` and the AWS request ID from the Lambda context.
    - Creates an instance of the AWS SES service (`ses`).
    - Prepares `params` object required for the SES `sendEmail` method:
        - Defines the email recipient's address from `AppConfig.recipientMailAddress`.
        - Defines the sender's address from `AppConfig.senderMailAddress`.
        - Sets the email subject and body based on the `status` and `errorObj` provided.
    - Uses `ses.sendEmail` to send the email asynchronously.
    - Provides a callback function that handles the result of the email sending operation:
        - If there's an error during the email sending process, it logs an error message using `log.error`.
        - If the email is sent successfully, it logs a success message using `log.info`.

3. **SES Configuration:**
    - The function assumes the AWS credentials and configuration are already set up and available through the AWS SDK.

This function encapsulates the logic to send alert emails using AWS SES based on the provided status (success/failure) and error details. It uses predefined constants for email subjects and messages, and it logs the success or failure of the email sending process for monitoring and error tracking purposes.
