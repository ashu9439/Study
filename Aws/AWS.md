Disaster recovery in AWS involves creating strategies to minimize downtime and data loss in case of system failures or disasters. AWS offers services like Amazon S3 for data backups, AWS Backup for centralized management, and services like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CloudEndure for creating resilient architectures and replicating data across regions to ensure availability even in case of failures in a specific region. Establishing recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) helps determine how quickly and how much data needs to be recovered in case of a disaster.
