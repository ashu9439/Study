Since 2021, React has seen several updates. Some notable changes include:

1. **React 18 Release**: Introduced concurrent rendering with the "startTransition" API, improved server-side rendering, automatic batching updates, and more.

2. **Concurrent Mode**: This feature allows React to pause and resume rendering updates, enhancing performance by prioritizing more important tasks.

3. **Suspense for Data Fetching**: React Suspense has been further developed to handle asynchronous data fetching, making it easier to manage loading states and data fetching in components.

4. **New JSX Transform**: Introduced a new JSX transform that provides a smoother development experience and reduces the need to import React in every file when using JSX.

5. **Server Components (Experimental)**: This feature aims to simplify server-rendered applications by allowing components to be rendered on the server, bringing improvements in performance and developer experience.

6. **Improved Developer Tools**: Updates have been made to the React DevTools to provide better insights into the component hierarchy, performance profiling, and debugging capabilities.
