SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol used for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It's a messaging protocol that allows programs running on different operating systems to communicate with each other by using XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

Here are the key components and concepts related to SOAP API:

1. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):** SOAP messages are built using XML. XML provides a way to encode data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

2. **SOAP Envelope:** The SOAP message structure consists of an envelope that contains the header and body of the message.

3. **SOAP Header:** This part of the SOAP message is optional and contains information like authentication details, message routing, and other metadata.

4. **SOAP Body:** This is where the actual data being sent is placed. It contains the payload of the message.

5. **WSDL (Web Services Description Language):** WSDL is an XML format used for describing a web service and its available methods, parameters, and data types. It serves as a contract between the service provider and the consumer.

6. **HTTP or HTTPS:** SOAP messages are typically transmitted over HTTP or HTTPS protocols. They are sent as part of the body of an HTTP request.

To interact with a SOAP API, you need to:

- **Understand the API Documentation:** Read the API documentation to understand the structure of the SOAP requests and responses, including the endpoints, methods, parameters, and expected data format.

- **Use a SOAP Client:** You can use programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, etc., with libraries or modules that provide SOAP client capabilities to interact with SOAP APIs. These libraries often provide methods to create SOAP requests and parse SOAP responses.

- **Construct SOAP Requests:** Build SOAP requests by creating XML structures that adhere to the format specified in the API documentation. Include necessary headers, method calls, and parameters.

- **Send SOAP Requests:** Use HTTP(S) POST requests to send the SOAP request to the API endpoint.

- **Handle SOAP Responses:** Receive the SOAP response, parse the XML, and extract the relevant data from the response body.

For example, in Python, the `suds` library or the `zeep` library can be used for interacting with SOAP APIs. In Java, JAX-WS or Apache CXF can be used.

Do note, while SOAP was popular in the past, more lightweight and RESTful APIs (using JSON) have gained prominence due to their simplicity and ease of use. REST APIs are more commonly used for web services now, but SOAP is still prevalent in certain enterprise-level systems.
